# Personal Bio via GitHub

This is a web site hosted via GitHub pages using the "special IO repository name" mechanism provided by GitHub.

It is a cummulative example of the homework assignments given in the first few weeks of the Coding Bootcamp hosted by UNC Chapel Hill.

The site incorporates the Bootstrap CSS framework and the jQuery API to provide responsiveness in both user interaction and viewing platform.
