                  <p>
                      I began my career as a developer in 1992 by negotiating a subsidy from my employers, the owners of a convenience store franchise I managed. They also owned <em>(i.e., had the controlling shares of)</em> a local business college and picked up half of my tuition when I agreed to manage their store. I worked full time during the day and went to classes part time at night.
                  </p><p>
                      By my graduation in May, 1995, I was already working full time as a developer programming in C. I was creating automations for the
                      CAD software used by my coworkers. I soon became "the computer guy" and, over the next eight years, learned more than I could have imagined about computers, networks, operating systems and software development. It was an amazing experience.
                  </p><p>
                      While working at this job I started going to school part time again. I attended a nearby university to get my CS degree. Having the opportunity to immediatley incorporate <em>(i.e. at my day job)</em> the theory I was learning was remarkably beneficial. It was a win-win situation for my employer and me. During this time I became passionate about programming languages. I relished learning about language specifications, the compilation process and compiler implementations. I strove to understand the intricacies of syntax and lexical analysis. I was an avid participant in the computer language news groups on UseNet <em>(the forerunner of what is now Stack Overflow)</em>. Understanding the nuances between language specifications and their various implementations provided the troubleshooting and debugging skills I use to this day.
                  </p><p>
                      Now with a couple decades under my belt, I'm thrilled to be sharing my knowlege with people eager to learn development. I've often thought about teaching professionally and always enjoyed the opportunities I've had to work with interns and junior developers. I'm looking forward to seeing passion for development ignite in those just embarking on the journey.
